* Description
The `dart` module wraps `dart-mode`, with LSP code completion for `.dart` files,
syntax highlighting, etc. Included is a `+lsp` flag for enabling LSP features,
and a `+flutter` flag for working with Flutter.

** Maintainers
+ @sevensidedmarble (Author)

** Module Flags
+ =+lsp= Will start LSP automatically in `dart-mode-hook`.
+ =+flutter= Adds the `flutter` package and some settings for Flutter development.

** Plugins
+ [[https://github.com/bradyt/dart-mode][dart-mode]]
+ [[https://github.com/amake/flutter.el][flutter.el]]

* Prerequisites
Make sure that the Dart SDK is on your `PATH`, and if using Flutter, make sure
the Flutter binary is on your `PATH` as well.

* Features
+ Syntax highlighting and formatting for `.dart` files provided by LSP
+ Emacs functions for running and debugging Flutter projects

* Configuration
** Dart & Flutter
On Linux, the installers for Dart and Flutter use the `/opt` directory, and this
module assumes that. However, you may set `lsp-dart-sdk-dir` to your Dart
install directory, if it differs, to make sure LSP can find the language server
included with the Dart SDK.

Alternatively, these variables shouldn't be necessary if you just include Dart
and Flutter on your `PATH` variable.
** Android
You will also need to setup your system for Android development if you intend to
use Flutter to develop mobile applications. Refer to your distributions package
manager for details. In most distributions the `/opt/android-sdk` directory is
used, and you might have to change some permissions in this directory since it's
owned by root. The [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Android][Arch Linux wiki has a great guide on this here.]]

* Troubleshooting
See the configuration section for information on the binaries for Dart and
Flutter. On new installs to the `/opt` directory, you will likely need to edit
the permissions of the `/opt/dart-sdk` and `/opt/flutter` directories (not to
mention the Android SDK, as discussed above).
